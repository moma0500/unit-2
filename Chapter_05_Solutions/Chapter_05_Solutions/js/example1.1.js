//GOAL: Proportional symbols representing attribute values of mapped features
//STEPS:
//1. Create the Leaflet map--done (in createMap())
//2. Import GeoJSON data--done (in getData())
//3. Add circle markers for point features to the map--done (in AJAX callback)

//4. Determine which attribute to visualize with proportional symbols
//5. For each feature, determine its value for the selected attribute
//6. Give each feature's circle marker a radius based on its attribute value
